<h3><strong>Goals for this course</strong></h3>

<p>I know basically nothing about any part of web building (except for modular web building sites like weebly that any idiot can use), so I'm looking forward to expanding my skillset! I'm not really sure how relevant html is now though, I've heard that it's becoming a bit obsolete (especially since I believe it was written in like the 70's). Is it still pretty widely used? </p>

<h4><strong>Brief description of myself</strong></h4>
<p>I'm an indian guy who comes from the shining metropolis of Aurora, CO. I enjoy playing and modding video games, playing drums and percussion, playing tennis, and doing photo and video editing.</p>
